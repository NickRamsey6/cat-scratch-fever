t7e9ad3fb147b476885ef935738876434,1,They have not been meeting substitute needs lately and will not communicate when they do not have someone. I am the one that has to call and follow-up with someone to find out if we  will get a substitute nurse come out to the school. Sometimes it seems they have forgotten to find someone. Most of the time I know that I do not have anyone when there is not a nurse that shows up at the school or I get told the day before because I have reached out.  Also they will tell me that they have someone but then the person cancels at the last moment.
